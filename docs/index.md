# Mitoverse

[Mitoverse](https://mitoverse.i-med.ac.at) provides a free quality control and contamination detection tool. You can upload alignment files (BAM,CRAM) or variant files (vcf, vcf.gz) and receive a graphical and textual report which can be shared with collaborators.

Currently the workflow includes the following steps:

* Variant and Heteroplasmy Detection 
* Haplogroup Detection with Haplogrep2
* Contamination Detection
* Graphical Report Creation
