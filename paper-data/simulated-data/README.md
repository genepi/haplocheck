# Simulated data

## Input 
### all-500k
Mixture of two haplogroup profiles. Filenames include amount of noise (0-32)

###  h-100k
Mixture of two haplogroup profiles from H haplogroups. Filenames include amount of noise (0-32).

## Output
All VCF files have been analysed with haplocheck with different setups (changing haplogroup quality, amount of heteroplasmies.
